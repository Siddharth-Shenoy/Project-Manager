# Project-Manager


Project Manager is a tool for creating project directories with default files also is a utility for developers to build their files without typing the whole command on their command line. Supports build options in an INI file hence reduces the efforts to type and on top of that increases the readability of the command.

To build this project you can simply type the following command in the directory where the source files are present:

```
g++ main.cpp -o projectmanager
```

**More of recommended**
If you want to access the projectmanager in any folder (which is what it is meant for) you should copy the 'projectmanager' to:
'/bin/'


```
cp projectmanager /bin/
```

# NOTE
These source files are currently compilable on g++ for linux hence you have to wait for source files which are available for windows
